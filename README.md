# Smart-automatic-watering-system
• Objective: Automatically monitor and adjust the amount of water for plants based on soil moisture and environmental conditions.

• Main features:
o Automatically turn on/off the pump when soil moisture exceeds or falls below the allowed threshold.

o Display data (temperature, air humidity, soil moisture) on LCD and Blynk App.

o Manual and automatic modes, allowing users to switch and control remotely.

o Notify plant watering status (moisture status) via V6 label on the application.

• Technology used: ESP8266, DHT11, Soil Moisture Sensor, Relay + Pump, Blynk App, Arduino IDE, Wi-Fi TCP/IP, LCD I2C.

• Results:
o The system operates stably, can be expanded to many pots of plants.

o Applying IoT technology helps save water, automate plant care, and support remote management via phone.
